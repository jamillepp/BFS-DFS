# BFS-DFS
I created a Breadth-first and a Depth-first search algorithm so you dont need.

# Struture
You need to pass a graph with this format:

  ### G [ V[], E[] ]
  
Where G its a Array with two itens:

  ### V = a Array of numbers like this [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ], that will be the labels of your nodes.
  ### E = a Array of tuples with two numbers that represents the edges of your graph, like this [ (1, 2), (1, 3), (3, 4) ]
